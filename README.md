**Models**: *Decision Tree, Random Forest*  
**Libraries**: *Sklearn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Mlxtend*   

In the Customer Churn Project, detailed customer analysis was carried out to better understand the profile of people who will be churned, and customer churn was estimated using ***Decision Tree*** and ***Random Forest Models***.

### Some of the questions I aim to answer in Exploratory Data Analysis are: 
- What are the distributions of Gender, Subscription Type and Contract Length?
- What is the Churn percentage by Gender?
- What is the distribution of Contract Length on Churn?
- What is the relationship between Usage Frequency and Churn?
- What is the relationship between Age and Churn?
- What is the relationship between Support Calls and Churn?
- What is the relationship between Payment Delay and Churn?
- What is the relationship between Total Spend and Churn?
- What is the relationship between Last Interaction and Churn?
- What is the relationship between Tenure and Churn?

### About Customer Churn
*Customer churn* refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship or subscription with a company or service provider. Churn is an important metric for businesses as it directly impacts ***revenue, growth,*** and ***customer retention***. A *churned customer* is one who has decided to discontinue their subscription or usage of the company's services. 

Understanding customer churn is crucial for businesses to identify patterns, factors, and indicators that contribute to customer attrition.

- By analyzing churn behavior and its associated features, companies can develop strategies to *retain existing customers, improve customer satisfaction,* and *reduce customer turnover*.
  
- Predictive modeling techniques can also be applied to forecast and proactively address potential churn, enabling companies to take proactive measures to retain at-risk customers.
